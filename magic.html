                    <h2>Magic</h2>
                        <p>Magic in The Infinite Reality is the art of harnessing the energies and forces that permeate reality. It involves communicating with external sources of power, such as Reality, Deities, or other mystical entities, to shape and manipulate the world around oneself. This intricate practice varies among individuals, with some drawing power from these external sources while others possess a deep connection with the natural energies</p>
                        <p>Magic does not operate on particles but is rather manifestations in Reality by whatever higher power is communicated with (In a similar way that a 3D being puts its finger on a 2D plane creating a “manifestation” in that 2D plane), often being Reality itself. Something with QD-DNA will be invisible to foreign Realities and therefore manifestations will be unable to exist in the presence of their quantum flux existence</p>
                        <p>Magicians, like Wizards and Witches, use precise articulation, whether through words, thoughts, runes, sigils, or other forms of communication, to weave their magic and create specific effects. Their proficiency in communicating their intentions to the fabric of Reality determines the potency of their spells and enchantments</p>
                        <p>Warlocks, in contrast, draw their power from Deities or make pacts, enabling them to access unique and diverse abilities granted by their patrons. Paladins, similarly, serve under Deities, vowing oaths that empower them with divine might.</p>
                        <p>Sorcerers, a unique class, possess the ability to draw power from objects or their ancestral bloodline, granting them distinct ways to wield magic. This exceptional talent is challenging to master, but those who achieve it become formidable wielders of mystical abilities.</p>
                        <p>Druids, with a strong connection to nature and the primal forces, commune with the natural energies around them, their deep bond with the elements and creatures of the natural world allowing them to replicate or manipulate these energies with profound skill.</p>
                        <p>Bards channel their magical abilities primarily through music, using it as a form of communication with Reality or other sources of power, creating spells and persuading others through their melodic and harmonic expressions</p>

                    <h2>Inner Power</h2>
                        <p>Inner Power in The Infinite Reality is a latent source of energy and potential residing within each individual. It is an inherent aspect of their being, accessible to varying degrees. Most beings possess inner power, although its extent and utilization vary greatly from person to person. This internal energy can be harnessed to enhance physical attributes, unleash primal rage, or tap into heightened states of awareness and focus. While some may tap into this power instinctively, many remain unaware of its existence.</p>
                        <p>Psions, Mystics, and Monks are among the few who actively seek to harness and refine their inner power, using it to perform extraordinary feats. Psions possess a rare and powerful talent that allows them to bend reality on a smaller scale, manipulating the world around them through their inner power. Mystics manipulate the mind and reality itself, drawing from their inner power to wield unique abilities, a gift possessed only by a select few individuals in The Infinite Reality. Monks, on the other hand, focus on refining their inner power to fight with precision and skill, using their abilities to temporarily disrupt their opponents' inner power or enhance their physical abilities without the need for weapons. These skilled individuals demonstrate the true potential of harnessing one's inner power within The Infinite Reality.</p>

                    <h2>Magic vs Inner Power</h2>
                        <p>In the hands of a great magic user, the various magic techniques and abilities are viewed as versatile tools and techniques rather than mere titles or fixed identities. These accomplished practitioners fluidly switch between different forms of magic, combining them creatively to achieve specific and powerful results. Their mastery allows them to draw from multiple sources of power, utilizing communication with Reality, Deities, or their inner power as needed to suit the situation.</p>
                        <p>For example, a skilled magician might seamlessly transition between arcane spells as a Wizard, runes and potions as a Witch, or drawing from a Deity as a Warlock, all depending on the complexity of the task at hand. They may utilize the primal forces of nature like a Druid, manipulate the mind like a Psion, or embody an astral self as a Way of the Astral Self Monk</p>
                        <p>In the Infinite Reality, magic users understand that their abilities are not rigidly confined to the definitions of their respective classes. Instead, they view these abilities as tools in a vast repertoire, honed through practice and experience, to wield magic as a force of great power and versatility. By mastering the art of magic in all its forms, these exceptional individuals transcend the limitations of traditional titles and become true maestros of mystical potential.</p>

                    <h2>Runes</h2>
                        <p>While Runes can be used for spells such as fireball, they are typically not. Runes are made with a system of language in the symbols and to take time to set up a lone fireball rune is pointless. Runes are typically used in complicated spells that combine various Runes and draw from specific items that are required for more powerful or longer spells that can't be accomplished by simple evocation.</p>
